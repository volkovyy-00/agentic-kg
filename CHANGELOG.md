## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Contributor workflow (#5)**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` (PR/branch conventions, testing requirements, design-decision
  and CHANGELOG policy) and `CHANGELOG.md` (this file, with backfilled release history).

### Changed
- `.gitignore` narrowed from ignoring all of `docs/` to just `docs/superpowers/` (design specs/plans) and
  `docs/backlog/` (defect/follow-up notes) (#5) — a prior blanket ignore had silently untracked two design
  specs during the 0.3.0 merge, recovered from git history rather than lost.
- Conversational model bumped to DeepSeek V4-Flash's official `0731` release, superseding the preview build.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **Grounded graphrag retrieval (#4)**: schema-profile-aware querying with completeness and partition
  annotations, replacing reliance on conversational recall. Adds context filtering for ADK's cross-agent
  event history, a two-layer schema-profile cache, and bounded/summarized query results.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`schema_refinement_loop` feedback-clobbering bug (#3)**: the loop's `before_agent_callback` reset
  feedback on every iteration instead of once per invocation, discarding critique mid-loop.

### Added
- Per-turn invocation cap on `schema_refinement_loop` (#3), preventing the coordinator from silently
  chaining multiple full propose/critique rounds within a single user turn.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Foundation (#2)**: file sources via `fsspec`, driver-side CSV loading, and OpenRouter with per-job
  model selection.

### Security
- **Path traversal in file source resolution (#2)**: an unchecked relative path (e.g. `"../.env"`) could
  escape the configured source root and read arbitrary files, including the OpenRouter key and Neo4j
  credentials in `.env`.

### Fixed
- Driver-side CSV loading replaces `LOAD CSV FROM file:///`, which Neo4j Aura rejects (#2).
- `finished()`'s private-API parent-agent lookup, replaced with a documented public-API path (#2).
- A ragged CSV row could silently erase properties an earlier row had already loaded onto the same
  entity (#2).
- `schema_refinement_loop` could silently revert a user-requested schema fix with no error surfaced (#2).
- File reads defaulted to the platform's locale encoding instead of `utf-8`, and OpenRouter calls with no
  `max_tokens` cap could pre-authorize against the full token ceiling and fail with an opaque 402 (#2).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- `tool_result` API mismatch between unit tests and the real `(key, result)` signature (#1).
- Integration tests' Neo4j test-container password default, and a result-key mismatch reading
  `send_query()`'s output (#1).

### Added
- Documentation of the colima/Testcontainers `DOCKER_HOST` + Ryuk workaround needed to run integration
  tests locally (#1).
