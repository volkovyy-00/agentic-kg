        When constructing an example graph with mock data, 
        always design a simple schema that is easy to understand.
        Use a small number of nodes and relationships.

        When constructing a graph from files always follow these steps:
        1. analyze the data sources. how are they related?
        2. design a physical graph schema that fits the available data and the user's goal
        3. create appropriate constraints for nodes with unique IDs
        4. load all node files first
        5. then load all relationship files
